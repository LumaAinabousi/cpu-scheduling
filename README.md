# Project Title: CPU Scheduling Algorithms Comparision

Description: Aimed to do a performance comparison regarding the average turn-around time and average waiting time; I Implemented and ran four different CPU Scheduling Algorithms using python
- Round Robin (RR)
- Shortest Remaining Time First (Preemptive SJF)
- Preemptive Priority Scheduling 
- First-come First-serve (FCFS)
